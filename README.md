# rock-paper-scissors
This is a project from the [Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com/courses/foundations/lessons/rock-paper-scissors). It has my own twists. It does not use strings to determine the round results but instead uses a pre-defined array of results, via match codes (0 = loss, 1 = win, 2 = tie) and choice numbers (1 = rock, 2 = paper, 3 = scissors). I felt this to be a good approach; instead of a long if..else block of string checking, it's a simple switch-case statement.
